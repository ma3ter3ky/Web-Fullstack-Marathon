<h2 id="what-makes-a-superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
<p>
    A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
    So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could
    possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be
    considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or
    detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
    becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
    accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

        Flash(Barry Allen)

    <p>
        is a superhero and a forensic scientist, who can channel the speed force,
        allowing him be the fastest man alive and a founding member of the Justice League.
        Though there are many iterations of The Flash,
        Barry Allen is the second iteration, and is considered the most iconic iteration from DC comics.
