# 🌍 Web Fullstack Marathon

Welcome to the next step of my programming journey!  
This part is all about mastering the **web stack** – from the very basics to building complete applications.

## 🏗️ Fundamentals
Starting with the building blocks of the web:
- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – styling  
- **JavaScript** – interactivity

## 🚀 Fullstack Development
Moving from front-end to back-end:
- **Node.js & Express** for server-side logic  
- **Authentication** for secure user access  
- **Mail registration** to handle real-world features

## 🎯 Goal
From static pages ➝ to dynamic, full-featured web apps.  
Learning to connect all layers of the stack and deliver real projects.
